# Crazy Capture Tic Tac Toe (4×4)

Crazy Capture Tic Tac Toe is an innovative twist on the classic Tic Tac Toe game. Played on a 4×4 grid, two players (X and O) take turns placing their marks. The objective is to align four marks in a row, column, or diagonal. Unique capture rules allow you to remove an opponent's mark by sandwiching it—earning an extra move and creating chain explosions.

## How to Play

- **Turns:** Two players alternate turns, marking empty cells.
- **Winning:** Get four marks in a row, column, or diagonal.
- **Capture Rule:** When your mark sandwiches an opponent's mark (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally), the opponent's mark is captured (removed) and you get an extra move. Multiple captures trigger a chain explosion that removes adjacent opponent pieces.
- **Animations:** Enjoy fade-in effects when placing marks and explosion animations on captures, with a win highlight when the game is won.

## Features

- **4×4 Grid Gameplay:** A larger board for strategic depth.
